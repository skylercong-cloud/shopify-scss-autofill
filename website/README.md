# Website

Minimal website for **shopify-scss-autofill**.

## Local

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deploy

Deployment is handled by GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

Notes:

- This is a GitHub Pages project site, so `vite.config.js` sets `base: "/shopify-scss-autofill/"`.
